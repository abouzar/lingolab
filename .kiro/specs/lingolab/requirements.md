5. WHEN a user reviews flashcards THEN the system SHALL randomize the order to prevent pattern memorization

### Requirement 5: Custom Training Set Management

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to create and manage custom training sets, so that I can focus on vocabulary relevant to my specific interests and needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to create a training set THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to add words, phrases, and their translations
2. WHEN a user creates a training set THEN the system SHALL allow them to name and categorize the set
3. WHEN a user wants to edit a training set THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and modifying entries
4. WHEN a user deletes a training set THEN the system SHALL confirm the action and remove associated progress data
5. WHEN a user accesses training sets THEN the system SHALL display all their custom sets with metadata (word count, creation date, last studied)

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered Word Suggestion

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want AI to suggest related words when I input a few words, so that I can discover and learn vocabulary in semantic clusters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters seed words THEN the system SHALL use AI to generate semantically related words
2. WHEN AI suggests words THEN the system SHALL provide translations and context for each suggestion
3. WHEN a user reviews suggestions THEN the system SHALL allow them to select which words to add to a training set
4. WHEN a user creates a set from suggestions THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a training set with the selected words
5. WHEN generating suggestions THEN the system SHALL consider the user's current language level and existing vocabulary

### Requirement 7: Import/Export Functionality

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to import and export word lists in standard formats, so that I can use external resources and backup my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to import data THEN the system SHALL accept JSON and CSV file formats
2. WHEN importing a file THEN the system SHALL validate the format and display a preview before importing
3. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL generate files in JSON or CSV format with all word list data
4. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL handle duplicate words appropriately (merge or skip)
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as progress statistics and creation dates

### Requirement 8: Exam Generation

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to generate exams from my word lists, so that I can test my knowledge comprehensively and track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests an exam THEN the system SHALL generate questions from selected word lists
2. WHEN creating an exam THEN the system SHALL offer multiple question types (multiple choice, fill-in-blank, translation)
3. WHEN a user takes an exam THEN the system SHALL track their answers and provide immediate feedback
4. WHEN an exam is completed THEN the system SHALL display results with detailed performance breakdown
5. WHEN generating exam questions THEN the system SHALL ensure appropriate difficulty distribution based on user's progress

### Requirement 9: Story Generation

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want AI to generate stories using my vocabulary words, so that I can see words in context and improve reading comprehension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a story THEN the system SHALL generate a coherent narrative incorporating selected vocabulary words
2. WHEN generating a story THEN the system SHALL adjust complexity based on the user's language level
3. WHEN a story is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the target vocabulary words
